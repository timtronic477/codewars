# Escape the room

# You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( dict in Python) called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties (e.g. name, description, completed

rooms = {"room1":{"name": 'room1', "description": 'first room', "completed": True}, "room2":{"name": 'room2', "description": 'second room', "completed": True}, "room3":{"name": 'room3', "description": 'third room', "completed": True}}
