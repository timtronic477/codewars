# Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

# 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1
# 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
# 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
# Given two positive integers n and p, we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n raised to consecutive powers starting from p is equal to k * n.

# In other words, writing the consecutive digits of n as a, b, c, d ..., is there an integer k such that :

# (
# 𝑎
# 𝑝
# +
# 𝑏
# 𝑝
# +
# 1
# +
# 𝑐
# 𝑝
# +
# 2
# +
# 𝑑
# 𝑝
# +
# 3
# +
# .
# .
# .
# )
# =
# 𝑛
# ∗
# 𝑘
# (a 
# p
#  +b 
# p+1
#  +c 
# p+2
#  +d 
# p+3
#  +...)=n∗k
# If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

# Note: n and p will always be strictly positive integers.

# Examples:
# n = 89; p = 1 ---> 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1

# n = 92; p = 1 ---> -1 since there is no k such that 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k

# n = 695; p = 2 ---> 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

# n = 46288; p = 3 ---> 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

def dig_pow(n, p):
    # your code
    # n i number that's being multiplied out
    # p is number that will multiply n to get total number that numbers are multiple consecutively
    # p is the number you start at
    num_str = str(n)
    total = 0
    for index, char in enumerate(num_str):
        digit = int(char)
        total += digit ** (p + index)
