# The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he could have made a mistake.

# Could you help him?
# Task

# The function should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average.

# Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us either to throw an error or return such value so he will clearly see that his expectations are not great enough.

# In "Sample Tests" you can see what to return.
# Notes:

#     all donations and new average are numbers (integers or floats), array of donations can be empty.
#     See examples below and "Sample Tests" to see which return is to be done.

# array: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 92 -> result: 645
# array: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 2  -> result: variable, see "Sample Tests
