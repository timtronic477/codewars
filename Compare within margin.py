# Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b.

# Please note the following:

#     When a is close to b, return 0.
#         For this challenge, a is considered "close to" b if margin is greater than or equal to the absolute distance between a and b.

# Otherwise...

#     When a is less than b, return -1.

#     When a is greater than b, return 1.

# If margin is not given, treat it as if it were zero.

# Assume: margin >= 0

# Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.

def close_compare(a, b, margin=0):
    if margin >= abs(a-b):
            return 0
    return -1 if a < b else 1
