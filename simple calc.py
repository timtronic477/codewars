# You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

# Your function will accept three arguments:
# The first and second argument should be numbers.
# The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

# if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.
# Example:

# calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3
# calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"

def calculator(x,y,op):
    return eval(str(x) + op + str(y)) if op in ["+", "-", "*", '/'] else 'unknown value'
