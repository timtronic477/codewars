# Each floating-point number should be formatted that only the first two decimal places are returned. You don't need to check whether the input is a valid number because only valid numbers are used in the tests.

# Don't round the numbers! Just cut them after two decimal places!

# Right examples:  
# 32.8493 is 32.84  
# 14.3286 is 14.32

# Incorrect examples (e.g. if you round the numbers):  
# 32.8493 is 32.85  
# 14.3286 is 14.33
