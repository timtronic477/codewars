# Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

# You need to consider the following ratings:

# Terrible: tip 0%
# Poor: tip 5%
# Good: tip 10%
# Great: tip 15%
# Excellent: tip 20%
# The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:

# "Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
# ...or null in Java
# ...or -1 in C#
# Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.
